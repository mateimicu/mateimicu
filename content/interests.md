This is a page with topics I'm interested in. In some I already have some experience in some I'm just curious and want to experiments.
I'll link the posts, resources, projects related to each topic.

#### Neural Networks
I already started experimenting with this through [Coursera Machine Learnin](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and
a course at my university. Currently I implemented backpropagation with various activation functions, cost functions and improvements.
I want to study more the math behind some of this optimizations and use them in a side-project.

#### Distributed systems
I experimented with some of this systems (some using blockchain) some hybrid solutions. One interesting project I want to try and 
understand better is [IPFS](https://ipfs.io).

#### Blockchain
I already know how the basic system described by [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
work but I want to implement it and explore deviations like ETH.

#### Go and C/C++
I already have knowledge with C/C++ but I want to explore the new features from C++. I'm new using Go but it seems interesting and want to do some
side projects in it.

#### Cpython
I worked with Python for over 5 years now but I want to explore more about the Cpython implementation.

#### Vim Scripting
I'm a vim user but I'm really familiar with internals and how to really take advance of the automation/scripting that can improve my 
vim workflows.

#### Docker/Kubernetes
